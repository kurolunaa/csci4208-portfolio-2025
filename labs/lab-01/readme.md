# Lab-01 Intro to HTML
This is a pretty entertaining lab, it introduces HTML in a way that makes it engaging while still focusing on the basics of HTML. I've experimented with HTML before, and while it is kind of ugly because we don't touch CSS yet, I still learned something new like with i-frame.

Nothing is required for this lab, everything can run from the index.html located in the lab, but I recommend launching it from this [repo's github pages](https://kurolunaa.github.io/csci4208-portfolio-2025/) due to how autoplay audio works.
