# Lab-02 Intro to CSS
This lab focuses on the basics of CSS, and the end result shows off what CSS can do. I like how this lab shows off multiple different configurations of the some features like padding.

Once again, nothign is required for this lab and everything can run from the index.html located in this lab. However still I recommend launching it from this [repo's github pages](https://kurolunaa.github.io/csci4208-portfolio-2025/) for easy access.

## Features
- Many, many CSS features to display ranging from colors, spacing, fonts, etc.
