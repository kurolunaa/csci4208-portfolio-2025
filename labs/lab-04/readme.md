# Lab-04 Intro to JavaScript
I had some trouble with this lab towards the end, when converting the buttons to images they weren't doing anything and it took me about 5 minutes to figure out what was going on but it ended up being a minor typo for one of the variables. Overall this was pretty fun, but I'd definitely need more practice to become more confident in using JavaScript.

No prequisites are required for this lab. This lab can be opened from this [repo's github pages](https://kurolunaa.github.io/csci4208-portfolio-2025/) under Lab-04.
