# Lab-05 Phaser Game: Dodger
This lab serves as an example of how to use JavaScript in a more object-orientated manner. In this lab, the Phaser Framework was also introduced, although it's main purpose was to assist in how object-orientated JavaScript works by building a simple "dodger" style game.

The game this lab walks through involves the player shooting projectiles, while dodging enemy projectiles. As enemies spawn your score goes up, and if you beat the high score, you are prompted to enter your name, with the new high score being saved temporarily until the page refreshes.

The game itself is simple, but with how this lab implements this game, it's very modular and I can see how it can be modified to add new features in the future, if needed. 

This lab serves as a good starting point/example to look at/steal code from for when we get into Project 2.

No prequisites are required for this lab. This lab can be opened from this [repo's github pages](https://kurolunaa.github.io/csci4208-portfolio-2025/) under Lab-05.

## Features
- A simple dodger game that has a complete gameplay loop
- High Score tracker (although it's lost on refresh)
- Player and enemy projectiles
- Powerups that modify DOM elements
- Scene transitions in the form of title screen/game screen
